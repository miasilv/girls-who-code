      <h1> Our Mission </h1>
      <p>
        We wish to inspire and revitilize the women's rights movement with broader ideals 
        of feminism with the goal of changing society to value all women in whatever they 
        want to do no matter their position in society.

      <h2> What does it mean to be a feminist? </h2>
      <p>
        We advocate for women's rights and promote equality among the sexes, providing 
        equal oppurtunities no matter your gender. There have been many progressive steps
        throughout the women's rights movement and there has been hard opposition to it 
        as well. We will continue to work towards a more equal society and change the 
        world for all the young girls to come.

      <h2> How does intersectionality relate? </h2>
      <p>
        Mirriam Webster Dictionary defines intersectionality as the "the complex, cumulative 
        way in which the effects of multiple forms of discrimination combine, overlap, or 
        intersect." Intersectional Feminism focuses on the diverse expereinces of ALL women.
        In the past, the women's rights movement centered around middle to upper class white women,
        but it is now shifting to promote the intersectionality within feminism.
